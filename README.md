# portal-functions

### Installation
To get started, the first thing you need to do is to install the Firebase CLI, to do that, open your terminal and type:

```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Once installed, go ahead and use the CLI to log into your Firebase Console with:

```
firebase login
```

It will open a browser window for you to log in. 

And lastly, if not already initialized, move to the folder where you have your project and initialize Cloud Functions with:

```
firebase init functions
```

It will ask you a few things, like selecting if you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript, choosing the project itâ€™s going to associate in your console, etc.

Choose TypeScript, and it will give you TSLint and will help you catch errors before they happen :)

### Deploy Function

#### Select Environment:

```
firebase use <app-id-in-.firebaserc>
```

For Dev:

```
firebase use rct-portal---dev

#### Set configurations:

```

#### Then Deploy Functions as:

firebase use <rct-portal---dev|rct-portal>
firebase deploy --only functions:fun-name,functions:addMessage,functions:makeUppercase
